# Autism-Prediction

The Autism prediction project helps classify if a patient has Autism with the help of the AQ test ( Autism quotient Test) and a set of other personal parameters.

To run the code, we can change the location where the google drive file is present under the first cell of Reading Train and Test. 

Under the Data Visualization part, we have visualized relationships among the data with the help of graphs, charts and heat maps. 

Under the Model part, we have written a small RandomTreeClassifier Model to see which are the most relevant parameters so we could eliminate the others.
